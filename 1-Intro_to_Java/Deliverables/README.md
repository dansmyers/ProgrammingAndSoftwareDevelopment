# Sprint 1 &ndash; Deliverable Programs

## Description
Write Java programs for each of the following. Create a separate `.java` file for each question and put your code in the `main` method of the class. Put all of your Java files into one ZIP archive and submit the ZIP file through the assignment on Canvas.


## Unit of Measure

My son Scott has created a new unit of length called the **Scottometer**. The purpose of the Scottometer is, in his words, "to measure the size of the solar system". Confusingly, 1 Scottometer is defined to be 1 million miles.

Write a Java program that reads a number of miles from the console (using a `Scanner`) and prints the equivalent number of Scottometers. Here is a skeleton to help you get started.

```
/**
 * Scottometer Converter
 */
 
import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class Scottometers {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        // Create a Scanner that reads from the standard input
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Add your code here
    
    }

}
```

Tips:

- Put your code in a file named `Scottometers.java`. Remember that capitalization is important for class and file names.

- Use `double` variables to store the numbers of miles and Scottometers.

- Use the `Scanner`'s `nextDouble` method to read a `double` value from the console.

- Look at the `InchesToCentimeters.java` example.

Dogecoin, the favored cryptocurrency of shiba inus everywhere, currently trades for about $.003 per DOGE.

Write a program that can take a value in dollars as input and output the equivalent number of dogecoins. Print your answers to two decimal places.

Tips:

- Use a `Scanner` and the `nextDouble` method to read from the console.

- To print to two decimal places, use `System.out.printf("%.2f", dogecoins)`, where `dogecoins` is the variable that holds the number of dogecoins you want to print.

- Use a `final double` to store the conversion factor:

```
final double USD_PER_DOGE = .003;
```


## Binet's Formula

You've heard of the famous Fibonacci sequence, where each term is calculated by adding the two previous terms:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

Suppose you would like to calculate the *n*<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number. How could you do that?

One way is to start at the base case and grind your way up through the sequence until you've calculated *n* total terms.

It turns out, though, that there is a **single formula** that will calculate the terms of the Fibonacci sequence. This is weird and suprising, because it seems unlikely that such a highly structured sequence, where each term depends on all the previous terms, could be represented in closed form. The result is know as **Binet's formula**, and it says that the Nth Fibonacci number *f*<sub>*n*</sub> is

Gnarly.

The number `(1 + sqrt(5)) / 2` is the famous **golden ratio**, the most aesthetically pleasing of all proportions. It's sometimes denoted by the Greek letter Ï† (phi) after the ancient architect and sculptor Phidias, who used it in planning the design of the Parthenon.

Write a Java program called `Binet.java` that prompts the user for a value of *n* and then uses Binet's formula to calcuate the *n*<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number.

Tips:

- Again, use a `Scanner` to read from `System.in`. Use the `nextInt` method to read an `int` value from the console.

- Use `Math.sqrt()` to calculate square roots. For example,

```
double phi = (1 + Math.sqrt(5)) / 2;
```

Finish the Magic 8-Ball program given in the `Magic8Ball.java` example. The program should prompt the user for a question, then return one of following ten possible answers
selected at random.

- It is certain.
- It is decidedly so.
- Signs point to yes.
- Reply hazy, try again.
- Ask again later.
- Better not tell you now.
- Concentrate and ask again.
- Don't count on it.
- My reply is no.
- My sources say no.
