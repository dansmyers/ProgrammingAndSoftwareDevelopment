#  Intro to Java

## Assignment and reading due Tuesday, February 6

## Overview and Goals

This is it: the first unit. We're going to focus on two things:

1. Review the important elements of structured programming using Java.
2. Develop an appreciation for the ways that Java and Python are alike...and yet different.

At the end of the unit, you'll have two things to complete:

1. The deliverables described in this project.
2. Reading from the posted textbook.

The content for this unit will primarily be review from your previous class, although you will need to get started with Java, which may be new for you.


## Deliverables

Complete the five problems in `Deliverables`. Put each program into its own `.java` file, then put all of your files into a ZIP archive and submit them through the assignment posted to Canvas. I will show you how to add your files to a ZIP in class.

## Reading

Read the rest of Chapter 1 in the textbook, which covers all of the basic structured programming elements of Java.

## AI Statement

As you're probably aware, programs like ChatGPT can easily answer these early programming questions. However, the entire point of this assignment is to practice writing Java programs, so if you use an AI helper you'll be defeating the entire point of the assignment. Therefore, **no AI use is allowed on this assignment**. Be aware of the following:

- I have lots of experience looking at student programs. Therefore, I have a pretty good sense of when something looks like it was written by a real student or not. The effort you might invest in disguising AI-generated output is better spent just doing the assignment.
  
- GPT outputs are randomized, but not that randomized. I will be able to see if a significant group of students all hand in very similar programs.
  
- If you don't do this assignment honestly, you're going to struggle hard on the later ones where AI will be much less effective.
  
- Cheating is for the weak and mediocre, which doesn't include you.

## Java Features

At the end of this unit, you should be comfortable with the following Java features:

- Creating a `.java` file that contains a `public class` and a `main` method.

- The eight primitive types: `int`, `short`, `long`, `byte`, `char`, `float`, `double`, and `boolean`. Know what kind of data each type represents.

- Declaring variables, assigning values, and performing arithmetic.

- Using `Scanner` to read from the standard console input, including the `next`, `nextInt`, and `nextDouble` methods.

- Writing programs that read input and use it to perform calculations.

- Formatted printing using `System.out.printf`

- The six relational operators: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`

- Writing conditionals using `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.

- The logical operators: `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), `!` (logical NOT)

- Using `Math.random()` to make random choices.


## Tips

- **Don't wait until the last minute**. You won't have enough time to finish everything.

- **Remember the Honor Code** and my guidelines for acceptable collaboration.
