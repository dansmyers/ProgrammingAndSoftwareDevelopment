#  Intro to Java

## Assignment and reading due Thursday, January 28
## First quiz on February 4

## Overview and Goals

This is it: the first unit. We're going to focus on two things:

1. Review the important elements of structured programming using Java.
2. Develop an appreciation for the ways that Java and Python are alike...and yet different.

At the end of the unit, you'll have four things to complete:

1. The deliverables described in this project.
2. An individual quiz.
3. Reading from the ZyBook.

The content for this unit will primarily be review from your previous class, although you will need to get started with Java, which may be new for you.


## Deliverables and Quiz

Complete the five problems in `Deliverables`. Put each program into its own `.java` file, then put all of your files into a ZIP archive and submit them through the assignment posted to Canvas. I will show you how to add your files to a ZIP in class.

The quiz will be done **during class** on February 4. It is **open everything**: You can use any resources that you bring with you and find helpful.


## Reading

Complete the **participation questions** for Chapters 2 and 3 of the ZyBook. You don't need to complete the challenge questions or any sections that are marked as optional.

## Java Features

At the end of this sprint, you should be comfortable with the following Java features:

- Creating a `.java` file that contains a `public class` and a `main` method.

- The eight primitive types: `int`, `short`, `long`, `byte`, `char`, `float`, `double`, and `boolean`. Know what kind of data each type represents.

- Declaring variables, assigning values, and performing arithmetic.

- Using `Scanner` to read from the standard console input, including the `next`, `nextInt`, and `nextDouble` methods.

- Writing programs that read input and use it to perform calculations.

- Formatted printing using `System.out.printf`

- The six relational operators: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`

- Writing conditionals using `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.

- The logical operators: `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), `!` (logical NOT)

- Using `Math.random()` to make random choices.


## Tips

- **Don't wait until the last minute**. You won't have enough time to finish everything.

- **Remember the Honor Code** and my guidelines for acceptable collaboration.
