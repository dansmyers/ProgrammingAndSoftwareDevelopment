# Practice Writing Objects

## Cars

Write a class called `Car` in a file named `Car.java`. Your class should have the following private instance variables:

- `String make`
- `String model`
- `int year`

Write a constructor that initializes the values of the instance variables, get methods for each variable, and a `toString` method.

*Round guitars are totally not metal.*

Write a class called `Guitar` that represents a totally sweet rock n' roll guitar. Your guitar should have the following variables:

- `String brand`
- `String model`
- `int numStrings`
- `boolean isPointy`
