# Methods and Recursion &ndash; Deliverables

## Recursion Practice

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Myvtk0G.jpg" width="50%" />

The following three problems ask you to implement non-trivial recursive methods. 

**You must use `Recursion.java` in this directoy as a starting point for your solutions**: It contains stubs for the static methods you need to implement. 
New for this project! **Automated testing**. The  `main` method of `Recursion.java` contains a series of tests that will evaluate your static methods
for different inputs and report if they are producing the correct outputs.

Each recursive method is worth one point. You'll get credit for each problem if you pass all of its tests.

Tips:

- Don't edit the `main` method.
- **DO NOT USE ANY LOOPS**. Your solutions must be recursive! Using a loop for any of the problems is an automatic unsatisfactory.
- Don't create any global or class variables outside of a method. All of your variables must be **local**.


### The Collatz Sequence

Given an arbitrary positive starting integer `n`, it's possible to create a sequence by repeatedly applying the following rules:

```
if n is even, the next number is n / 2
if n is odd, the next number is 3 * n + 1
```

For example, beginning with 6, the sequence is: 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

Lothar Collatz conjectured that this sequence always converges to 1 for any starting positive integer `n`. No counterexample
has ever been found, but the Collatz conjecture has never been formally proven.

Complete the method `collatz(n)`, which recursively calculates the length of the Collatz sequence with starting value `n`. For example,

```
collatz(1) = 1  (because 1 is the base case)
collatz(8) = 4  (because the sequence is 8, 4, 2, 1)
collatz(6) = 9  (because the sequence is 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)
```

Hint: the length of the sequence starting with 6 is 1 plus the length of the sequence starting with 3.

```
collatz(6) = 1 + collatz(3)
```

Likewise,

```
collatz(3) = 1 + collatz(10)
```

Putting those ideas together, here's a sketch of the method you can use as a starting point:

```
public static int collatz(int n) {
    
    // 1 is the base case
    if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    
    // Recursive case: return 1 + collatz(m)
    // where m is the number that comes after n using the rules of the sequence

}
```

**Do not use any global or class instance variable to count the length of the sequence**. Any variables you use must be **local** within the `collatz` method.



### Negative Fibonacci Numbers

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci sequence:

```
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(n) = fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1)
```

The last rule can be rewritten as

```
fib(n - 2) = fib(n) - fib(n - 1)
```

or equivalently,

```
fib(n) = fib(n + 2) - fib(n + 1)
```

This definition makes it possible to extend the Fibonacci sequence to **negative values of `n`**.

```
fib(-1) = fib(1) - fib(0) = 1
fib(-2) = fib(0) - fib(-1) = -1
fib(-3) = fib(-1) - fib(-2) = 2
fib(-4) = fib(-2) - fib(-3) = -3
```

The negative side of the sequence has the same values as the positive side, but offset by 1 and with alternating signs.

Complete the method `fib(n)` which finds the `n`th Fibonacci number. Your method has to work for both positive and negative values of
`n`.

### McCarthy's 91 Function

Mathematician John McCarthy and his colleagues defined the following function:

```
M(n) = 

    n - 10        if n > 100
    M(M(n + 11))  if n <= 100
```

This function is interesting because it evaluates to 91 for all inputs `n <= 100`. For larger values,

```
M(101) = 91
M(102) = 92
M(103) = 93

and so forth...
```

Implement the function `mccarthy(n)` to calculate McCarthy's 91 function.

(No, you can't just make it return 91. You have to do the evaluation recursively.)


## Notakto

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Three-board_Notakto.svg/1920px-Three-board_Notakto.svg.png" width="50%" />

### Description

Notakto is a Tic-Tac-Toe variant where there are only X's. Both players take turns marking X's on the board and the first player who 
completes a line of X's **loses**.

Implement a Java program to play Notakto using `Notakto.java`as your starting point.

This project will let you practice:

- Creating, accessing, and iterating over two-dimensional arrays
- Writing and using static methods
- Reading user input
- Implementing game logic

### Specifications

This entire project is worth **six points**. You will earn one point for each of the following criteria.

- Formatted printout of the game board, using the format shown below.
- Reading user input from the console; use a `while` loop to retry until the user inputs a valid number.
- Converting the user's input number into a position in the board and marking that position as `true` or `false`
- Identifying the losing condition of three X's in a row.
- Identifying the losing condition of three X's in a column.
- Identifying the losing condition of three X's in a diagonal.

You must also include JavaDoc-style comments for each method.

### Tips

**Work in small phases**. Don't try to code the entire game in one step. Implement one small piece at a time, test it, and move on to the next piece only when things are working correctly.

#### Variables

The board is a 3x3 grid of `boolean` values.

```
boolean[][] board = new boolean[3][3]
```

Using booleans is appropriate because each position can have only two values: open or marked with an X. You'll also need to create a `Scanner` to read input from the terminal.

#### Printing the Board

Call the `print` method to print the current game board at the beginning of each turn. Use the following format.

```
 1 | 2 | 3
---|---|---
 4 | 5 | 6
---|---|---
 7 | 8 | 9
```

The user will enter one of the numbers 1-9 to select the location of the next X. Once a location has been selected, print an X in its spot:

```
 1 | X | 3
---|---|---
 4 | X | 6
---|---|---
 7 | 8 | X
```

Here is some example code to help you get started with `print`. It loops over the two-d grid and prints either an `X` at each position (if the value at that position
is `true`) or a number 1-9 (calculated from the values of the loop index variables `r` and `c`). You will need to modify this method to make it print with the format
shown above.

```
/**
 * Print the board
 * 
 * @param  board  the 3x3 Notakto board
 */
public static void print(boolean[][] board) {
    for (int r = 0; r < board.length; r++) {
        for (int c = 0; c < board[r].length; c++) {
            if (board[r][c]) {
                System.out.print("X");
            } else{
                System.out.println(r * 3 + c + 1);
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println();
    }
}

```

#### Valid Input

You need to read the user's move as a number 1-9. If the user enters an invalid number or tries to choose a square that is already occupied, use a `while` loop to force
another choice. Here is an example. The `covertToRow` and `convertToCol` methods take the user's choice 1-9 and turn it into the corresponding row or column number, as
discussed below.

```
boolean readingInput = true;

while (readingInput) {
    System.out.println("Choose an open position.");
    int choice = input.nextInt();
    
    if (choice < 1 or choice > 9) {
        System.out.println("That is not a valid choice.");
        continue;
    }
    
    int row = convertToRow(choice);
    int col = convertToCol(choice);
    
    if (board[row][col] == false) {
        readingInput = false;
    } else {
        print a message saying that space is occupied
    }
}
```

#### `covertToRow` and `converToCol`

These two methods take an `int` value 1-9 as input and return the corresponding row or column number.
```
/**
 * Convert a position 1-9 into the corresponding row number
 *
 * @param  position   the user's choice, which must be 1-9
 * @return            the row associated with that position
 */
public static int convertToRow(int position) {

     // Positions 1, 2, 3 are on the first row of the board
     if (position <= 3) {
         return 0;
     }
     
     // Positions 4, 5, and 6 are on the second row
     else if (position <= 6) {
     
     } 
     
     // Positions 7, 8, 9 are on the third row
     else {
     
     }
}
```

It's also possible to directly calculate the row from the position number by taking advantage of integer division.

```
int row = (position - 1) / 3
```

You'll need to write a similar method for `convertToCol`.

#### Checking the Losing Condition

The three `check` methods all look for three consecutive X's and return `true` or `false`. For example, to check the rows you could write:

```
public static void checkRows(board) {

    // Loop over the rows and check each one for three X's
    for (int r = 0; r < board.length; r++) {
        if (board[r][0] && board[r][1] && board[r][2]) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    // If you complete the loop then no row can have three X's -- return false
    return false;
}
```

This code uses a loop to check each row. If all of the entries in a row are `true`, the method passes the check and returns `true`. If you complete the loop, then you must
have checked all three rows without ever finding a group of three, so the method returns `false`.

Write similar methods for `checkCols` and `checkDiags`.

#### Turns

As in the previous games, use a `player` variable to keep track of the current player's turn. Switch this variable to the other player at the end of the main game loop.
