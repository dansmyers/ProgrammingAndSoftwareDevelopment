# Methods and Recursion

## Project and reading are due on 2/25

## Overview and Goals
This sprint will review the use of methods in Java, including passing arguments and returning values, and introduce **recursion**, one of the most
important concepts in computer science that you'll see over and over again in your future classes.

## Deliverables and Quiz

Complete the problems in `Deliverables`. Put each program into its own `.java` file, then put all of your files into a ZIP archive and submit them through the assignment posted to Canvas.

## Reading

Complete the **participation questions** for Chapters 6 and 7 of the ZyBook, on methods and recursion. You don't need to complete the challenge questions or any sections that are marked as optional.

## Java Features

At the end of this sprint, you should be comfortable with the following Java features:

- Writing `static` methods.

- Passing arguments to static methods and returning values.

- Java's rules of variable scoping and the concept of local variables. The concepts of the stack and the heap as locations where variables may be stored in memory.

- Defining the base and recursive cases of a recursive method. Implementing recursive methods.

- Using a stack diagram to reason about what happens in a sequence of method calls.


## Schedule and Tips

We will work through examples and answer questions every day in class. In addition to the class work, the following schedule will help your groups stay on track.

- Start with the method examples. It often takes some time to understand the process of calling a method, passing in arguments, and returning a value. Work through the
examples until you're comfortable with methods that take inputs and return values. After we go through a few examples, I'll be assuming that you're okay with code that
uses methods for organization, rather than putting everyting in `main`.

- Look at the recursion examples. The most important thing to understand about these early recursive problems is the concept of the recursive case (where the method
calls itself) and the base case (where the method doesn't call itself and just returns immediately). For each example, pay attention to how the base and recursive 
cases are implemented.

- Complete the reading **before** attempting the projects. The background info from the reading will help you complete the assignment.

- If you need to see more examples of methods and recursion, take a look at the chapters in [*Think Java*](https://greenteapress.com/thinkjava7/html/) by Allen Downey, 
which is available free on the Web.
