# Sprint 5 &ndash; Graphics and Objects

<img src="http://www.hrwiki.org/w/images/3/3f/peasantsquest.png" width="50%" />

## Deliverables are due on Tuesday, 4/19

## Overview and Goals

Our goal in this unit is to continue our discussion of object-oriented programming in Java by writing some more complex programs that combine classes and objects with 
graphical output. There will be few new features added during this sprint, but we'll be building on what we learned last time to create larger programs. By the end
of this sprint, you should have a good grasp of creating objects that represent specific entities in a program and using their properties and methods to implement
non-trivial interactions.

## Deliverables and Quiz

Complete the project in `Deliverables`. Remember that you may work with another person and you may use any resources that you find helpful to
complete the project. Put each program into its own `.java` file, then put all of your files into a ZIP archive and submit them through the assignment posted to Canvas.

## Reading

There's **no required reading** for this assignment.

## Java Features

At the end of this project, you should be comfortable with the following Java features:

- Creating your own classes to represent "things" in your program.

- Adding instance variables and methods to your classes.

- Java's access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default access modifier.

- Writing and calling constructor methods.

- Using a "driver" class to serve as the `main` for a program.

- Creating a moderately large program using object-oriented principles.

- Using the `StdDraw` library to create graphical programs and games.


## Schedule and Tips

Most of the material that we'll cover in this unit is an extension of the previous unit. If you're not 100% comfortable with objects and classes yet, review the `Book` 
class and the other simple examples from the last unit. You can also review the `Ball`, `SecretCollect`, `Pong`, and `Snake` labs.
