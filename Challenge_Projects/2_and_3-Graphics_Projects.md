# Challenge Projects

## Both projects due 4/30 (the last day of class)

## Overview

The last two Challenge Projects are taken from the text. Both ask you to build graphical applications that combine all of the techniques we've talked about during the class.

The two projects are independent; you can complete one, both, or neither. Remember that each project you successfully complete will raise your final letter grade by one part of a letter (e.g., B to B+, or B+ to A-). You'll write separate files and make separate submissions for each project.


### Challenge Project 2: Falling Sand

Complete the *Falling Sand* project from Chapter 7 of the book. It leads you through building a graphical application that uses a particle model to simulate falling grains of sand. It also features using mouse input, colors, and an important graphics technique called **double buffering**.

Submit your `FallingSand.java` class to the assignment I'll create on Canvas.


### Challenge Project 3: Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set is the iconic fractal image. It's famous for the self-similar details it contains at infinitely small scales.

Implement the Mandelbrot set viewer project in Chapter 9. This will show off more imaging, working with complex numbers, and HSV color maps. This project is fairly long, but the text works through all the code that you'll need. Tip: Make sure you build incrementally. Follow the instructions and pause to test each portion of the project when it tells you to.

Submit your `Mandelbrot.java` class to the assignment I'll create on Canvas.
