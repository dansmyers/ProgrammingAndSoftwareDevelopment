## Assignment and reading due on Thursday, February 3

## You may work with a partner on this assignment.

## Overview and Goals
This unit will introduce important features of Java that we'll be using for the rest of the class:

- The `while` and `for` loops.
- One-dimensional arrays, including creation, indexing elements, and using loops to access arrays.
- An intro to two-dimensional arrays.

All of these features (with the possible exception of 2-D arrays) are similar to things we used in the previous class, but there are several
differences between Java's loop and array implementations and Python's `for` loop and lists.


## Deliverables

Complete the problems in `Deliverables`. Remember that you may work with a partner if you want to. Put each program into its own `.java` file, then put all of your files into a ZIP archive and submit them through the assignment posted to Canvas.

## Reading

Complete the **participation questions** for Chapters 4 and 5 of the ZyBook. You don't need to complete the challenge questions or any sections that are marked as optional. The reading is due on the same day as the assignment.


## Challenge Problem

The last problem on the assignment, Treblecross, is our first **challenge problem**. This problem is optional for the basic assignment, but you must complete at least four challenge problems this semester to earn a B or an A.


## Java Features

At the end of this sprint, you should be comfortable with the following Java features:

- Writing a `while` loop with a guard variable.
- Using a `while` loop to repeatedly prompt for input until the user enters a valid value.
- Testing for `String` equality using `equals` and the difference between that method and the `==` operator.
- Using a `for` loop to iterate through a range of numbers.
- Using `for` loops and `if-else` statements to find numbers satisfying certain properties.
- Declaring 1-D arrays.
- Accessing array elements.
- Using a loop to print the elements of an array, find the max or min value, sum the elements, initialize an array to a starting value, or perform other
similar operations.
- The differences between Java arrays and Python's lists.
- Declaring and accessing 2-D arrays.
- Using a pair of loops to print the elements of a 2-D array.

## Schedule and Tips

- Look at the Staircase and Pyramid examples, which show you how to combine multiple loops, counting variables, and printing to produce structured output. These will help you do the second problem.

- The third problem (the Subtraction Game) is more complex, but doesn't require any new features.

- The last two problems take a little longer to explain; part of the challenge is understanding the problem before you code it. Make sure you understand the magic square algorithm and try it out by hand if you need to
before you attempt to code it. Most of the work in the last problem (Treblecross) is writing the conditions that check for the winning condition. Completing the Subtraction
Game first will help you with Treblecross.

- **Don't wait until the last minute**. You won't have enough time to finish everything.
