# Arrays and Loops

## Assignment due on Thursday, February 11

## Overview and Goals
This unit will introduce two important features of Java that we'll be using for the rest of the class: loops and arrays.

- The `while` and `for` loops.
- One-dimensional arrays, including creation, indexing elements, and using loops to access arrays.
- An intro to two-dimensional arrays.

All of these features (with the possible exception of 2-D arrays) are similar to things we used in the previous class, but there are several
differences between Java's loop and array implementations and Python's `for` loop and lists.


## Deliverables and Quiz

Complete the problems in `Deliverables`. Remember that you may work freely with the members of your team and you may use any resources that you find helpful to
complete the project. Put each program into its own `.java` file, then put all of your files into a ZIP archive and submit them through the assignment posted to Canvas.

## Reading

Complete the **participation questions** for Chapters 4 and 5 of the ZyBook. You don't need to complete the challenge questions or any sections that are marked as optional.
The reading is due on the same day as the assignment.

## Java Features

At the end of this sprint, you should be comfortable with the following Java features:

- Writing a `while` loop with a guard variable.
- Using a `while` loop to repeatedly prompt for input until the user enters a valid value.
- Testing for `String` equality using `equals` and the difference between that method and the `==` operator.
- Using a `for` loop to iterate through a range of numbers.
- Using `for` loops and `if-else` statements to find numbers satisfying certain properties.
- Declaring 1-D arrays.
- Accessing array elements.
- Using a loop to print the elements of an array, find the max or min value, sum the elements, initialize an array to a starting value, or perform other
similar operations.
- The differences between Java arrays and Python's lists.
- Declaring and accessing 2-D arrays.
- Using a pair of loops to print the elements of a 2-D array.

## Schedule and Tips

- Look at the Staircase and Pyramid examples, which show you how to combine multiple loops, counting variables, and printing to produce structured output. These will help
you do the second problem.

- The third problem (the Subtraction Game) is more complex, but doesn't require any new features.

- The last two problems take a little longer to explain but aren't that challenging. Make sure you understand the magic square algorithm and try it out by hand if you need to
before you attempt to code it. Most of the work in the last problem (Treblecross) is writing the conditions that check for the winning condition. Completing the Subtraction
Game first will help you with Treblecross.

- **Don't wait until the last minute**. You won't have enough time to finish everything.
