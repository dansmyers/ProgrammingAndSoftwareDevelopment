# More Objects

## Both projects are due Tuesday, April 5 (unless that's Fox Day)

## Description

This folder contains two assignments that will allow you to continue to practice using object-oriented programming concepts, as well as Java's built-in `ArrayList` class.

- A **required** project to implement a blackjack game using the `Card` and `Deck` files we built in class.
- An **optional** challenge project to implement a spellchecking program using Java's built-in `HashSet`.

## Reading

Complete the participation questions for Chapters 10 and 11 in the ZyBook, on file input/output and collections. **You don't need to complete any questions from Chapter 9**, but please read the sections from Chapter 9 on garbage collection--it's useful background information.
