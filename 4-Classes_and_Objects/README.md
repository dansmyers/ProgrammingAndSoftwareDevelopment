# Classes and Objects

## Deliverables and reading are due on Sunday, 3/14

## Overview and Goals
This unit will introduce one of the most important concepts in software engineering: **object-oriented programming**. You might remember that we worked with objects and classes
briefly in Python, but their role in Java is much more fundamental to the entire nature and strucure of the language.

By the end of this unit, you'll be familiar with several important topics related to OOP in Java:

- Creating your own classes with instance variables and methods.

- Writing constructor methods.

- Access modifiers for data and methods.

- Using classes to organize your programs.

- Writing graphical programs using a drawing library.


## Deliverables

Complete the two programs described in the `Deliverables` directory. Both of these are more substantial that our previous projects and will require you to think hard about
the specifications for each program. Start early!

Please zip up **all** of the `.java` source files for both projects (including the supporting classes that I've included) in one directory and submit to the assignment that will be posted to Canvas. 


## Reading

Complete the **participation questions** for Chapter 8 of the ZyBook, on objects and classes. You don't need to complete the challenge questions or any sections that are marked as optional. The chapter also inclues some material about `ArrayList` that we'll use in future examples.


## Java Features

At the end of this sprint, you should be comfortable with the following Java features:

- Creating your own classes to represent "things" in your program.

- Adding instance variables and methods to your classes.

- Java's access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default access modifier.

- Writing and calling constructor methods.

- Using a "driver" class to serve as the `main` for a program.

- Creating a moderately large program using object-oriented principles.
