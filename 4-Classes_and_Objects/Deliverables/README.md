# Classes and Objects &ndash; Deliverables

## Description

You have two projects to complete:

- An implementation of John Conway's *Game of Life*, an **artificial life** simulation that models the births and deaths of cells living on a 2-D grid. 
Life is the best-known example of a **cellular automaton** and is famous for the intricate patterns it can produce without human input.

- Reading data from a file to answer questions about songs and artists that have appeared on the *Billboard Hot 100* record charts.
 
The Life project has starter code in the `Deliverables` directory, which you must use to develop your solution. Note that this project is more complex than anything we have developed so far.

- Take time to carefully read the descriptions and really understand the requirements for each problem.
 
- **Develop incrementally** and **test your code frequently as you develop**.
 
- **Start early**! Don't wait until the last minute. In particular, you should be able to write most of `Life` right away.

### Life

*Some people take this stuff really seriously.*

Read through the description in the `Deliverables` directory. Your job is to complete the `Life` class, which will include all of the logic needed to implement the simulation. The `Life` project includes a driver class named `RunLife` that implements four automated patterns.

- A simple three-square blinker that alternates between vertical and horizontal

- A glider, the iconic Life pattern that walks diagonally across the grid

- A more complex flashing pattern

- **Gosper's Glider Gun**, a pattern that produces an infinite stream of gliders. The Gun is named after Bill Gosper, who created it in 1970, winning $50 from 
John Conway for discovering the first Life pattern that could produce an infinite number of living cells.

Don't modify `RunLife`, but you may want to look at it to understand how it uses the `Life` class.
