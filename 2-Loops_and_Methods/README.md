# Assignment 2: Loops and Methods

## Due Friday, 3/1

## Overview

Complete the problems given in `Deliverables.md` and upload them in a zip file to the Canvas assignment I'll create.

This assignment will allow you to practice using loops and static methods in Java. After completing it, you should be familiar with

- The `while` loop
- Using a `for` loop to iterate over a range of integers
- Writing `static` methods that take inputs and return outputs
- Calling `static` methods from `main`
- Working with common `String` methods and character manipulation

The last part of the assignment will allow you to work with one of the encryption techniques described at the end of Chapter 1.

As always, **don't wait until the last minute**. This assignment is harder and the programs are longer than the ones on Assignment 1. In particular, the last problem will require you to read the examples from the book and think about how to modify them.

## Reading

Review the second part of Chapter 1. It has several examples on both `while` and `for` loops as well as methods.

For the last two problems, read the section on the Polybius square carefully and look at the encryption solution that you're given. Understanding how to implement encryption will help you with both the decryption and the following ADFGX problem.
