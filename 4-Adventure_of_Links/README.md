## Overview

This project is a grab-bag of questions related to our recent classes:

- Implementing methods for a `LinkedList` class
- Answering some written questions related to Big-O notation
- Implementing recursive methods

This project uses **autograding** for the programming parts. You have specific test cases that your programs must pass in order to get full credit.

Submit all of your files in one zip to the assignment I'll create on Canvas.

## Links

Complete the given `LinkedList` class by adding the following methods:


Tests for this program are given in `LinkedListTest`. Run `LinkedListTest` and it will automatically create an instance of your `LinkedList`, call its methods, and check the results to verify that your code works as expected. **You must pass the tests to get full credit**.

- Don't modify `LinkedListTest`!
- Start by implementing the first method, testing it until you pass, then move on to the second. You'll fail the tests for methods that you haven't implemented yet, but that's not a problem.
- Look at the relevant sections in the book for tips on implementing insertion, removal, and reversal.
